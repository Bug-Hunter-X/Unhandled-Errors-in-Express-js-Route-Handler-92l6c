# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Route Handler
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers that interact with databases.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:** The original code lacks proper handling for database errors and scenarios where a requested user does not exist. This leads to unexpected behavior and potentially exposes internal server errors to the client.

**Solution:** The solution includes comprehensive error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (500 for server errors, 404 for not found), and informative error messages to the client.
